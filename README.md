## Project Description: Daily Bike-Sharing Trip Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Networks

### Overview
This project explores the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict daily bike-sharing trips. The primary goal is to develop and evaluate models that can accurately forecast the number of bike trips, which can be beneficial for bike-sharing companies to optimize their operations and resources.

### Key Components

#### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- **Data Source**: The dataset consists of daily bike-sharing trip records.
- **Data Ingestion**: Utilized Apache Hadoop and PySpark to handle large datasets efficiently. CSV files were loaded into a Spark DataFrame and saved on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: The data was cleaned and transformed using PySpark, including converting timestamps to dates and aggregating trip counts by day.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Analyzed the central tendency, variability, and range of daily trips.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Examined the distribution and skewness of total trips per day.
- **Visualization**: Created histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to identify patterns and outliers.
- **Seasonality and Trend Analysis**: Decomposed the time series data to extract trend, seasonality, and residual components.

#### 3. Model Development
Three models were developed and evaluated:
- **Simple LSTM**: A basic Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with a single LSTM layer.
- **LSTM with Hyperparameters**: An enhanced LSTM model with multiple layers, dropout regularization, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **GRU Model**: A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model with a similar architecture to the enhanced LSTM.

#### 4. Model Training and Evaluation
- **Training**: Models were trained using TensorFlow, with a look-back period of 1 day for input sequences.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was used to evaluate model performance on training and test datasets.
- **Results**: The GRU model achieved the best performance with the lowest RMSE on the test set, indicating its robustness in capturing temporal dependencies.

### Insights and Conclusions
- **Seasonal Patterns**: The data exhibited clear seasonal patterns, with higher ridership in warmer months and weekdays.
- **Model Performance**: While the GRU model performed slightly better, all models showed limitations in prediction accuracy, suggesting that additional features (e.g., weather data, holidays) could improve performance.
- **Future Work**: Incorporating more contextual data and experimenting with different model architectures and hyperparameters could further enhance prediction accuracy.

### Visualizations
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Visualized the trend, seasonality, and residual components of the time series data.
- **Model Predictions**: Plotted the actual vs. predicted trip counts for both training and test sets to illustrate model performance.

### Technologies Used
- **Data Processing**: Apache Hadoop, PySpark
- **Modeling**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Programming Languages**: Python

This project demonstrates the potential of RNNs for time series forecasting in the context of bike-sharing systems, highlighting both the strengths and areas for improvement in predictive modeling.
